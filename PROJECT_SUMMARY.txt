NOVEL COMPONENTS (in src/models/components.py)
==============================================

1. PhonemeAttention
   - Cross-attention mechanism conditioning enhancement on phonetic content
   - Enables language-agnostic acoustic pattern learning
   - Uses gated fusion for adaptive phoneme influence

2. ContrastivePhonemeLoss
   - Novel loss for cross-lingual phoneme alignment
   - InfoNCE-based contrastive learning
   - Enables transfer from high to low-resource languages

3. PerceptualLoss
   - Multi-scale STFT loss for perceptual similarity
   - Operates on multiple time-frequency resolutions
   - Improves subjective audio quality

4. PhonemePreservationLoss
   - Ensures linguistic information preservation
   - Critical for maintaining speech intelligibility
   - Novel contribution to speech enhancement

5. AdaptiveMaskingLayer
   - Learned time-frequency masking conditioned on phonemes
   - Predicts optimal noise suppression masks
   - Key innovation combining phonetic and acoustic information

TRAINING FEATURES
=================

✓ MLflow integration (with try/except)
✓ Mixed precision training (torch.cuda.amp)
✓ Gradient clipping for stability
✓ Learning rate scheduling (cosine/step/plateau)
✓ Early stopping with patience
✓ Checkpoint saving (best + periodic)
✓ Multiple loss functions with configurable weights
✓ Gradient accumulation support
✓ Comprehensive logging

EVALUATION METRICS
==================

✓ PESQ (Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality)
✓ STOI (Short-Time Objective Intelligibility)
✓ SI-SDR (Scale-Invariant Signal-to-Distortion Ratio)
✓ Phoneme Preservation Rate (custom metric)
✓ Per-language analysis
✓ Statistical significance testing (mean + std)

TARGET METRICS:
- PESQ: 3.5
- STOI: 0.88
- Phoneme Preservation: 0.92
- Cross-lingual Transfer Gain: 0.15

USAGE EXAMPLES
==============

Training:
  python scripts/train.py --config configs/default.yaml --num_samples 1000

Ablation Study:
  python scripts/train.py --config configs/ablation.yaml --num_samples 1000

Evaluation:
  python scripts/evaluate.py --checkpoint checkpoints/best_model.pth

Prediction:
  python scripts/predict.py input.wav --output enhanced.wav --language en

Testing:
  pytest tests/ -v --cov=src

INNOVATION HIGHLIGHTS
====================

1. NOVEL APPROACH: Unlike standard denoising, explicitly conditions enhancement
   on phonetic content to preserve linguistic information during aggressive
   noise suppression.

2. CROSS-LINGUAL TRANSFER: Learns from high-resource languages (English, Spanish)
   and transfers to low-resource languages (Welsh, Basque) via contrastive
   phoneme alignment.

3. MULTI-STAGE ARCHITECTURE: Combines encoder-decoder with phoneme-conditioned
   attention and adaptive masking.

4. COMPREHENSIVE ABLATION: Full configuration for baseline comparison without
   phoneme-aware components.

TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS
===================

✓ Type hints on ALL functions
✓ Google-style docstrings
✓ Proper error handling with informative messages
✓ Logging at key points
✓ Random seeds for reproducibility
✓ Configuration via YAML (no hardcoded values)
✓ Test coverage >70% target
✓ Edge case testing
